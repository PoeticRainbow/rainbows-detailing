# A builder's companion

Rainbow's Detailing is an all-in-one resource pack that tweaks the visual style of the game to add details in many areas. Blocks you already use are given a boost in detail and greater harmony with other blocks. In the end, the pack will give you more possibilities with building.

Every addition in the pack is pixel consistent with Vanilla and uses proper parenting in the models. This means additions like the new model for Walls should work with any Walls added from a mod. If the mod is notable and the pack does not work, then I will consider adding support for it.

The pack is especially tailored to those who avoid resource packs in fear of their builds looking bad without them. The largest change that would affect your builds' looks would be the color swap of Stripped Dark Oak. The color is changed to match Dark Oak Planks and finally gives the Stripped Dark Oak a set of matching stairs and slabs in doing so. Without the pack, the log is desaturated and strangely lighter. This is your only worry in using my pack.
